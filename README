Welcome to Jacclog 
==================
Jacclog is an open source access log analysis application and is written
in Java. The modular architecture (OSGi) is based on Apache Karaf.

The goal of this application is the rapid analysis of access logs. At 
present only a file import and a statistical analysis with CSV export is
available. But that's just the beginning.

In future we will provide an additional importer interface for easy
integration into web server (eg for the Apache HTTP server) and a nice
Web-GUI for our users.

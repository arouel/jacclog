Building jacclog
============================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install Java SE 6 JDK, which can be downloaded from 
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.
   Use the latest version of Java SE 6 JDK.

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly installed 
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or 
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 3.0.3, which can be downloaded from 
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes 
   the MVN_HOME/bin directory. 


Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of jacclog source distribution.

2) Run
         $> mvn package
   This will compile jacclog and run all of the tests in the 
   Jacclog source distribution. Alternatively, you can run
   
   Depending on the load of remote Maven 2.0 repositories, you may have 
   to run "mvn clean package" several times until the required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some time for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build.

3) The distributions will be available under "assembly/target" directory.

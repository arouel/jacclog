			<!-- TODO: I reckon it's time for a new description -->
			<p>
				Jacclog is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
				(POM), Jacclog can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you think that Jacclog could help your project, you can find out more information about in the "About Jacclog"
				section of the navigation. This includes an in-depth description of
				<a href="what-is-maven.html">what Jacclog is</a>
				,
				a
				<a href="maven-features.html">list of some of its main features</a>
				, and a set of
				<a href="general.html">frequently
					asked questions about what Jacclog is
				</a>
				.
			</p>
			<h3>Learning about Jacclog</h3>

				reference area and a "cookbook" of common examples.

			</p>
			<h3>Documentation Index</h3>
			<p>
				If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the
				<a href="guides/index.html">documentation index.</a>
				<!-- TODO If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the documentation index. It is available in both <a href="todo.html">alphabetical</a> 
					and <a href="todo.html">categorical</a> listing formats. -->
			</p>
			<h3>How to Get Support</h3>
			<p>
				Support for Jacclog is available in a variety of different forms.
			</p>
			<p>
				To get started, search the documentation, the
				<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER">wiki</a>
				,
				<a href="issue-tracking.html">issue tracker</a>
				, or the
				<a href="mail-lists.html">mailing list archives</a>

				see if the problem has been solved or reported before.
			</p>
			<p>
